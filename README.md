# kOS-Shuttle-OPS3
Real Entry and Landing guidance for the Space Shuttle in KSP / RO

# Work In Progress, not yet functional

This will be the kOS implementation of the real-world Shuttle Entry, TAEM and Approach guidance, also including GRTLS  

Only designed to be compatible with my fork of Space Shuttle System (https://github.com/giuliodondi/Space-Shuttle-System-Expanded) with realistic aerodynamics
